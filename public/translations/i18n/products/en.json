When added to the above mentioned dangerous chemical products,         Denatonium Benzoate plays the role of a deterrent and contributes to prevent from hazardous ingestions by giving an extremely bitter and unpleasant taste to the products it is added to. Increasingly, companies decide to add Denatonium Benzoate to their manufacturing process to prevent accidental ingestion of household or garden products and provide maximum security to their customers. Denatonium Benzoate is one of the most bitter substances known and is equally used for many other purposes. It is indeed one of the substances most used for the denaturing of alcohol (especially ethanol) in order to make it undrinkable and ready for industrial uses. Denatonium Benzoate is also found in nail polish, where it helps to fight against onychophagy (i.e. severe nail biting). Its bittering properties make of Denatonium Benzoate an excellent repellent which, once added to phytosanitary products, contribute to deter animals from feeding on treated trees and plants. Its repellent qualities equally help to fight against rodents such as rats or mice.",
